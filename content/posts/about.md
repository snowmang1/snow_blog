# Hello, my name is Evan Drake

### <cite>My Interests[^1]</cite>
I hope to talk about many different topics here. My favorite genre of computer science
thus far in my studies has been language & compiler design. However I also have interests
in systems, optimization, and parallelism. Naturally much of this blog will have to do with
these idea's, though not all of it.

### Format
- Long form
- [Dialectic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dialectic) when possible
    - This is actually the purpose of my making a blog; as a form to learn.
- Code included (when possible)
- I plan to take any form of comment via the email attached to my GitHub account
- Markdown with LaTeX (and an RSS feed once I get it working)
- The goal is to post monthly
    - with this in mind know that every post will not be a complete project

Please enjoy your stay!! ❣️

All content on this blog is and will remain opinion based content none of this is formal or
published so it will remain simply my opinion.

[^1]: This is subject to change or growth as my interests are subject to change and growth.
